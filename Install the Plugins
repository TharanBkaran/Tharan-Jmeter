To install plugins for JMeter via the command line, you can use the jmeter-plugins-manager tool. Here are the steps:

Download the plugins manager: First, download the jmeter-plugins-manager JAR file from the official GitHub repository: JMeter Plugins Manager.

Place the JAR file: Place the downloaded JAR file (jmeter-plugins-manager-x.x.jar) in the lib/ext directory of your JMeter installation.

Run the installation command: Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the bin directory of your JMeter installation.

Execute the installation command: Use the jmeter script or jmeter.bat file along with the CMDRunner.jar file to execute the installation command. Here's the basic syntax:

bash
Copy code
java -cp CMDRunner.jar;plugins-manager-x.x.jar org.jmeterplugins.repository.PluginManagerCMDInstaller
Replace x.x with the version number of the plugins manager JAR file you downloaded.

Install plugins: After running the installation command, you can use the jmeter-plugins command to install plugins. Here's the syntax:

bash
Copy code
jmeter-plugins install [plugin-name]
Replace [plugin-name] with the name of the plugin you want to install.

For example, to install the "Dummy Sampler" plugin, you would run:

bash
Copy code
jmeter-plugins install jpgc-dummy
Similarly, you can install other plugins by providing their respective plugin names.

After running the installation command, JMeter will download and install the specified plugin(s) for you. You can then use them in your test plans as needed.
